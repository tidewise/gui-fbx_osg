# FBX IO plugin for OSG

This is a standalone version of the in-tree OpenSceneGraph plugin to load FBX
files. It is meant to be used within a Rock system.

The reason this package exists is that, because this plugin depends on
Autodesk's FBX SDK, OSG distributions do not compile this plugin by default.
